# What is hypothesis testing

## Researchers retain or reject hypothesis based on measurements of observed samples

## To determine whether retain or reject is based on "hypothesis testing"

## Steps of hypothesis testing

1. State the hypothesis
2. Type of testing
3. Decide the confidence interval
4. Calculate the testing statistic
5. Check if the testing statistic lies within rejection region
6. Reject or do not reject the null hypothesis

## How to state the hypothesis?

- Null hypothesis: an assumption that is made about the larger population, denoted by $H_0$
- Alternative hypothesis: negates the null hypothesis, denoted by $H_1$ or $H_a$

## Type of testing

- Testing of correlations
- Testing of proportions
- Testing of means
- etc...

## A simple hypothesis testing example: Is my coin fair?

## Is my coin fair? State the hypothesis

- Null hypothesis: there would be an equal number of occurrences of heads and tails if a coin is tossed several times(a fair coin!)
- Alternative hypothesis: the occurrences of heads and tails would have significant differences if a coin is tossed several times(a biased coin!)

## Is my coin fair? Type of testing

Testing of proportions.

## Is my coin fair? Decide the confidence interval

$$
\alpha = 0.05
$$

## Is my coin fair? Calculate the testing statistic

The $z$ statistic for proportion.

$$
z = \frac{P_1 - P_0}{\sqrt{\frac{P_0(1-P_0)}{n}}}
$$

```{r}
coin_toss <- rbinom(10000, 1, prob = 0.5) # Tossing a fair coin for 10000 times
n_of_heads <- sum(coin_toss)
p_heads <- n_of_heads / length(coin_toss)
p_0 <- 0.5
n <- length(coin_toss)
z_stats <- (p_heads - p_0) / sqrt(p_0*(1-p_0)/n)
z_stats
```

## Is my coin fair? Check if the testing statistic lies within rejection region

The $z_{-\alpha/2}$ and $z_{\alpha/2}$.

```{r}
alpha = .05
z_half_alpha <- qnorm(1 - alpha/2)
not_reject_region <- c(-z_half_alpha, z_half_alpha)
not_reject_region
```

## Is my coin fair? Reject or do not reject the null hypothesis

```{r}
z_stats <= max(not_reject_region) & z_stats >= min(not_reject_region)
```

The test statistic `r z_stats` which lies between the critical values of `r -z_half_alpha` and `r z_half_alpha`. Hence, at .05 significance level, we do not reject the claim that our coin is fair. Say, our coin is fair.

---

```{r}
prop_test <- prop.test(n_of_heads, 10000, p = 0.5, alternative = "two.sided")
prop_test$p.value < 0.05 # Do not reject null hypothesis
```

## Is my coin fair? Calculate the testing statistic

```{r}
coin_toss <- rbinom(10000, 1, prob = 0.3) # Tossing a biased coin for 10000 times
n_of_heads <- sum(coin_toss)
p_heads <- n_of_heads / length(coin_toss)
p_0 <- 0.5
n <- length(coin_toss)
z_stats <- (p_heads - p_0) / sqrt(p_0*(1-p_0)/n)
z_stats
```

## Is my coin fair? Reject or do not reject the null hypothesis

```{r}
z_stats <= max(not_reject_region) & z_stats >= min(not_reject_region)
```

The test statistic `r z_stats` which lies outside of the critical values of `r -z_half_alpha` and `r z_half_alpha`. Hence, at .05 significance level, we reject the claim that our coin is fair. Say, our coin is biased.

---

```{r}
prop_test <- prop.test(n_of_heads, 10000, p = 0.5, alternative = "two.sided")
prop_test$p.value < 0.05 # Reject null hypothesis
```

## Another simple hypothesis testing example: Is my dice fair?

## Is my dice fair? State the hypothesis

- Null hypothesis: there would be an equal number of occurrences of 1 to 6 if a dice is rolled several times(a fair dice!)
- Alternative hypothesis: the occurrences of 1 to 6 would have significant differences if a dice is rolled several times(a biased dice!)

## Is my dice fair? Type of testing

Testing of means.

## Is my dice fair? Decide the confidence interval

$$
\alpha = 0.05
$$

## Is my dice fair? Calculate the testing statistic

The $z$ statistic for mean.

$$
z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}
$$

---

```{r}
dice_rolls <- sample(1:6, size = 10000, replace = TRUE) # rolling a fair dice for 10000 times
x_bar <- mean(dice_rolls)
mu_0 <- mean(1:6)
n <- length(dice_rolls)
z_stats <- (x_bar - mu_0) / (sd(dice_rolls)/sqrt(n))
z_stats
```

## Is my dice fair? Check if the testing statistic lies within rejection region

The $z_{-\alpha/2}$ and $z_{\alpha/2}$.

```{r}
alpha = .05
z_half_alpha <- qnorm(1 - alpha/2)
not_reject_region <- c(-z_half_alpha, z_half_alpha)
not_reject_region
```

## Is my dice fair? Reject or do not reject the null hypothesis

```{r}
z_stats <= max(not_reject_region) & z_stats >= min(not_reject_region)
```

The test statistic `r z_stats` which lies between the critical values of `r -z_half_alpha` and `r z_half_alpha`. Hence, at .05 significance level, we do not reject the claim that our dice is fair. Say, our dice is fair.

## Is my dice fair? Calculate the testing statistic

```{r}
dice_rolls <- sample(1:6, size = 10000, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.5)) # rolling a biased dice for 10000 times
x_bar <- mean(dice_rolls)
mu_0 <- mean(1:6)
n <- length(dice_rolls)
z_stats <- (x_bar - mu_0) / (sd(dice_rolls)/sqrt(n))
z_stats
```

## Is my dice fair? Reject or do not reject the null hypothesis

```{r}
z_stats <= max(not_reject_region) & z_stats >= min(not_reject_region)
```

The test statistic `r z_stats` which lies outside the critical values of `r -z_half_alpha` and `r z_half_alpha`. Hence, at .05 significance level, we reject the claim that our dice is fair. Say, our dice is biased.

## More simple hypothesis testing examples: Is the time traveler a nut?

```{r}
library(quantmod)

start_date <- "2020-01-01"
getSymbols(Symbols = "AAPL", from = start_date)
sample_mean_price <- mean(AAPL["202003"]$AAPL.Adjusted)
sample_mean_price
```

## Is the time traveler a nut?

Suppose the time traveler claims that the mean adjusted price of AAPL is higher than 300 in 2020. In a sample of March, it was found that they are `r sample_mean_price`. At .05 significance level, can we reject the claim by the time traveler?

## Is the time traveler a nut? State the hypothesis

- Null hypothesis: the mean adjusted price of AAPL is higher than 300 in 2020
- Alternative hypothesis: the mean adjusted price of AAPL is not higher than 300 in 2020

## Is the time traveler a nut? Type of testing

Testing of means.

## Is the time traveler a nut? Decide the confidence interval

$$
\alpha = 0.05
$$

## Is the time traveler a nut? Calculate the testing statistic

The $z$ statistic for mean.

```{r}
x_bar <- sample_mean_price
mu_0 <- 300
n <- dim(AAPL["202003"])[1]
z_stats <- (x_bar - mu_0) / (sd(AAPL["202003"]$AAPL.Adjusted)/sqrt(n))
z_stats
```

## Is the time traveler a nut? Check if the testing statistic lies within rejection region

The $z_{-\alpha}$.

```{r}
alpha <- .05
z_alpha <- qnorm(1 - alpha)
-z_alpha
```

## Is the time traveler a nut? Reject or do not reject the null hypothesis

```{r}
z_stats <= z_alpha
```

The test statistic `r z_stats` is less than the critical value of `r -z_alpha`. Hence, at .05 significance level, we reject the claim that the mean adjusted price of AAPL is higher than 300 in 2020.

## From a time traveler's view of point

We falsely reject a TRUE $H_0$.

# Types of error

## There are 2 types of error might occur after we decided to accept or reject null hypothesis

1. **Type I error**: falsely rejecting a TRUE $H_0$
2. **Type II error**: falsely accepting a FALSE $H_0$

## Understanding these 2 errors via confusion matrix

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/4uhdZqN.png)

## In confusion matrix

- Positive refers to rejecting hypothesis
- Negative refers to accepting hypothesis

## There are 4 possible combinations

1. TP: truly rejecting a FALSE $H_0$
2. TN: truly accepting a TRUE $H_0$
3. FP: falsely rejecting a TRUE $H_0$ **Type I error**
4. FN: falsely accepting a FALSE $H_0$ **Type II error**
