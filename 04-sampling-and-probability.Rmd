# The measure of chances

## The definition of probability

$$
P(Event) = \frac{\text{Number of ways event can happen}}{\text{Total number of ways event can happen}}
$$

## Flipping a coin

```{r}
coin <- c("Head", "Tail")
sample(coin, size = 1, replace = TRUE)
```

## Rolling a dice for 2 times

```{r}
dice <- 1:6
sample(dice, size = 2, replace = TRUE)
```

## The `replace` argument

- `replace = TRUE` refers to independent events
- `replace = FALSE` refers to dependent events

## Independent vs. dependent events

- Events are independent if the probability of the latter isn't affected by the outcome of the previous, e.g. flipping coin and rolling dice
- Events are dependent if the probability of the latter is affected by the outcome of the previous, e.g. dealing cards

## Dealing poker cards

```{r}
generate_poker_deck <- function() {
  suits <- c("Spades", "Hearts", "Diamonds", "Clubs")
  ranks <- c("Ace", 2:10, "Jack", "Queen", "King")
  poker_deck <- c()
  for (s in suits) {
    for (r in ranks) {
      card <- sprintf("%s of %s", r, s)
      poker_deck <- c(poker_deck, card)
    }
  }
  return(poker_deck)
}
poker_deck <- generate_poker_deck()
sample(poker_deck, size = 13, replace = FALSE)
```

# Binomial distribution

## Flipping `size` coin(s) for `n` time(s) with built-in function `rbinom()`

```{r}
rbinom(n = 1, size = 1, prob = 0.5)  # single flip, single time
rbinom(n = 3, size = 1, prob = 0.5)  # single flip, many times
rbinom(n = 1, size = 3, prob = 0.5)  # many flips, single time
rbinom(n = 20, size = 3, prob = 0.5) # many flips, many times
```

## Other associated built-in functions for binomial distribution

- `dbinom()`
- `pbinom()`

## `dbinom()` function measures the probability of getting `x` successes out of `size` trials

```{r}
dbinom(x = 0, size = 10, prob = 0.5) # the probability of getting 0 head out of 10 times of single flip
dbinom(x = 1, size = 10, prob = 0.5) # the probability of getting 1 head out of 10 times of single flip
dbinom(x = 2, size = 10, prob = 0.5) # the probability of getting 2 heads out of 10 times of single flip
```

---

```{r}
n_head <- 0:10
n_head_probs <- dbinom(x = n_head, size = 10, prob = 0.5)
barplot(n_head_probs, names.arg = n_head, ylim = c(0, 0.25), main = "Probability of getting n heads out of 10 times")
```

## `pbinom()` function measures the probability of getting less than or equal to `x` successes out of `size` trials

```{r}
pbinom(q = 0, size = 10, prob = 0.5) # the probability of getting less than or equal to 0 head out of 10 times of trials
pbinom(q = 1, size = 10, prob = 0.5) # the probability of getting less than or equal to 0 head out of 10 times of trials
dbinom(x = 0, size = 10, prob = 0.5) + dbinom(x = 1, size = 10, prob = 0.5)
```

## What if we want to measure the probability of getting more than `x` successes out of `size` trials

```{r}
1 - pbinom(q = 1, size = 10, prob = 0.5)
pbinom(q = 1, size = 10, prob = 0.5, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

# Law of Large Number

## As the size of sample increases, the sample mean will approach the expected value

## The possibility of flipping a head

$$
P(Head) = 50 \%
$$

## Flipping a coin for 10 times

```{r}
coin_flips <- rbinom(10, size = 1, prob = 0.5)
p_head <- sum(coin_flips) / length(coin_flips)
p_head
```

## Flipping a coin for 100 times

```{r}
coin_flips <- rbinom(100, size = 1, prob = 0.5)
p_head <- sum(coin_flips) / length(coin_flips)
p_head
```

## Flipping a coin for 1000 times

```{r}
coin_flips <- rbinom(1000, size = 1, prob = 0.5)
p_head <- sum(coin_flips) / length(coin_flips)
p_head
```

## The average points of rolling a dice

```{r}
mean(1:6)
```

## Rolling a dice for 10 times

```{r}
dice <- 1:6
dice_rolls <- sample(dice, size = 10, replace = TRUE)
mean(dice_rolls)
hist(dice_rolls, breaks = 0:6)
```

## Rolling a dice for 100 times

```{r}
dice_rolls <- sample(dice, size = 100, replace = TRUE)
mean(dice_rolls)
hist(dice_rolls, breaks = 0:6)
```

## Rolling a dice for 1000 times

```{r}
dice_rolls <- sample(dice, size = 100, replace = TRUE)
mean(dice_rolls)
hist(dice_rolls, breaks = 0:6)
```

# Probability rules

## Probability of intersection

$$
P(A \; and \; B) = P(A) \times P(B)
$$

## We can use operator `&` for intersection

```{r}
coin_A <- rbinom(n = 10000, size = 1, prob = 0.5)
coin_B <- rbinom(n = 10000, size = 1, prob = 0.5)
mean(coin_A == 1 & coin_B == 1) # Both coin_A and coin_B are heads
```

---

```{r}
0.5 * 0.5
```

## Probability of union

$$
P(A \; or \; B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \; and \; B)
$$

## We can use operator `|` for union

```{r}
coin_A <- rbinom(n = 10000, size = 1, prob = 0.5)
coin_B <- rbinom(n = 10000, size = 1, prob = 0.5)
mean(coin_A == 1 | coin_B == 1) # coin_A is head or coin_B is head
```

---

```{r}
(0.5 + 0.5) - 0.5*0.5
```

## Flipping 3 coins

$$
P(A \; and \; B \; and \; C) = P(A) \times P(B) \times P(C)
$$

---

```{r}
# intersection
coin_A <- rbinom(n = 10000, size = 1, prob = 0.5)
coin_B <- rbinom(n = 10000, size = 1, prob = 0.5)
coin_C <- rbinom(n = 10000, size = 1, prob = 0.5)
mean(coin_A == 1 & coin_B == 1 & coin_C == 1)
```

---

```{r}
0.5**3
```

---

$$
P(A \; or \; B \; or \; C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - \\
(P(A) \times P(B) + P(A) \times P(C) + P(B) \times P(C)) + \\
P(A) \times P(B) \times P(C)
$$

---

```{r}
# union
coin_A <- rbinom(n = 10000, size = 1, prob = 0.5)
coin_B <- rbinom(n = 10000, size = 1, prob = 0.5)
coin_C <- rbinom(n = 10000, size = 1, prob = 0.5)
mean(coin_A == 1 | coin_B == 1 | coin_C == 1)
```

```{r}
(0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5) - (0.5**2 + 0.5**2 + 0.5**2) + 0.5**3

# The birthday problem

## What is the birthday problem

> There is a room(classroom?) with n people in it. What is the probability that anyone shares the same birthday?

## Assumptions of the birthday problem

- Ignore February 29th
- Each individual in the room is independent

## Using `sample()` to draw 40 samples from `1:365`

```{r}
dates_in_a_year <- format(as.Date(1:365, origin = "2019-01-01"), "%m-%d")
birthdays_num <- sample(1:365, size = 40, replace = TRUE)
birthdays <- dates_in_a_year[birthdays_num]
birthdays
```

## Extending the sampling to 10000 times

```{r}
counter <- 0
for (i in 1:10000) {
  birthdays_num <- sample(1:365, size = 40, replace = TRUE)
  if (length(unique(birthdays_num)) < length(birthdays_num)) {
    counter <- counter + 1
  }
}
p_same_birthday <- counter / 10000
p_same_birthday
```

## Defining a `p_same_birthday(n)` function which takes a single argument `n`

```{r}
p_same_birthday <- function(n, n_simulations = 10000) {
  counter <- 0
  for (i in 1:n_simulations) {
    birthdays_num <- sample(1:365, size = n, replace = TRUE)
    unique_birthdays_num <- unique(birthdays_num)
    if (length(unique_birthdays_num) < length(birthdays_num)) {
      counter <- counter + 1
    }
  }
  p_same_birthday <- counter / n_simulations
  return(p_same_birthday)
}
```

## Simulating 50 classrooms with 1 to 50 students

```{r}
same_birthday_probs <- sapply(1:50, p_same_birthday)
same_birthday_probs
```

---

```{r}
plot(same_birthday_probs)
```

# The Monty Hall problem

## [21](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478087/)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ZVdb45s.jpg)

## Contestant randomly pick 1 from 3 doors

```{r}
initial_pick <- sample(1:3, size = 1)
initial_pick
```

## Monty Hall will then reveal an empty door

Ask the contestant, "stick or switch?"

## Simulating the winning probability of "stick"

```{r}
winning_prob_stick <- function(n_simulations = 10000) {
  doors <- c(1,2,3)
  n_wins <- 0
  for(i in 1:n_simulations){
    prize <- sample(doors, size = 1)
    initial_pick <- sample(doors, size = 1)
    if(initial_pick == prize){
      n_wins <- n_wins + 1
    }
  }
  winning_prob <- n_wins / n_simulations
  return(winning_prob)
}
```

---

```{r}
winning_prob_stick()
```

## The "reveal strategy" of Monty Hall

- If the initially pick is correct, then Monty Hall will choose one of the other two doors at random to reveal
- If the initially pick is incorrect, then the host will simply reveal the other incorrect door, nothing random at this point

---

```{r}
reveal_strategy <- function(doors, prize, initial_pick){
  if (prize == initial_pick) {
    reveal <- sample(x = doors[-prize], size = 1) # Sample at random from the two remaining doors
  } else {
    reveal <- doors[-c(prize, initial_pick)] # When the prize and initial pick are different, reveal the remaining door
  }
  return(reveal)
}
```

## Simulating the winning probability of "switch"

```{r}
winning_prob_switch <- function(n_simulations = 10000) {
  doors <- c(1,2,3)
  n_wins <- 0
  for(i in 1:n_simulations){
    prize <- sample(doors, size = 1)
    initial_pick <- sample(doors, size = 1)
    reveal <- reveal_strategy(doors, prize, initial_pick) # reveal according to reveal_strategy
    final_pick <- doors[c(-initial_pick, -reveal)] # switch
    if (final_pick == prize) {
      n_wins <- n_wins + 1
    }
  }
  winning_prob <- n_wins / n_simulations
  return(winning_prob)
}
```

---

```{r}
winning_prob_switch()
```
